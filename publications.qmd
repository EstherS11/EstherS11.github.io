**ADEPT: RL-Aligned Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools — From Consensus Learning to Ambiguity-Driven Emotion Reasoning**

First Author

[Agentic LLM reasoning]{.keyword} · [Tool-augmented inference]{.keyword} · [RL alignment (GRPO)]{.keyword}

::: {.pub-tldr}
**TL;DR:** Proposes ADEPT, a pioneering agentic framework that transforms Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) from a static classification task into an active, evidence-grounded reasoning process using RL-aligned MLLMs. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning.

::: {.pub-keypoints}
**Key Points:**

- **Autonomous Agentic Framework:** Engineered an MLLM-based autonomous agent designed for multi-turn Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). The framework redefines emotion inference as an iterative inquiry process, where the agent programmatically orchestrates a specialized toolkit of semantic and acoustic probes to decode complex paralinguistic cues.
- **Evidence-Grounded Rationalization:** Developed a retrieval-augmented rationalization mechanism that anchors model predictions in verifiable physical evidence. By extracting and analyzing pitch trajectories, energy profiles, and spectral centroids, the system effectively mitigates text-biased hallucinations and provides high-fidelity, auditable reasoning traces.
- **Reinforcement Learning Alignment (GRPO):** Implemented Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the agent's multi-step decision-making trajectories. This alignment strategy optimizes the policy-driven evidence acquisition process, rewarding logical rigor and penalizing non-informative tool invocations to ensure the reasoning path aligns with human-expert diagnostic standards.
- **Ambiguity-Driven Reasoning:** Formulated a novel approach to address the "Consensus Paradox" by treating annotator disagreement as a valuable supervision signal rather than noise. By modeling emotional ambiguity through a consensus-driven inquiry process, the framework significantly improves robustness and recovery of co-occurring minor emotions on benchmark datasets including MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP.

This work explores how agentic multimodal models can move beyond pattern recognition toward verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning under perceptual ambiguity.

**Recovering Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition from Discrete Tokens via Multi-Layer Fusion and Paralinguistic Feature Integration**

First Author

[Discrete Audio Tokenization]{.keyword} · [Multi-layer Attention Fusion]{.keyword} · [SSL]{.keyword} · [Neural Codecs]{.keyword}

::: {.pub-tldr-icassp}
**TL;DR:** Introduces a multi-layer fusion framework to recover the significant performance loss in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) caused by audio discretization, enabling semantic-rich discrete tokens to rival high-fidelity continuous features.

::: {.pub-keypoints}
**Key Points:**

- **Performance Recovery:** Developed a novel framework that recovers 75% of the performance drop induced by discretization by integrating multi-layer WavLM tokens with 74-dimensional openSMILE paralinguistic features.
- **Architecture Innovation:** Designed and benchmarked dual fusion strategies—Layer-First and Modality-First—achieving an 8% gain with the Layer-First approach by prioritizing hierarchical feature extraction.
- **Ablation & Trade-offs:** Conducted systematic studies across 24 WavLM layers and 5 codebook sizes (K=256 to 4000) to identify optimal compression-accuracy trade-offs for emotion preservation.
- **Neural Codec Benchmarking:** Evaluated against three major neural codecs (SpeechTokenizer, DAC, and EnCodec), demonstrating that semantic-rich SSL tokens provide a 50%+ performance advantage over reconstruction-focused models for downstream SER tasks.

First Author | [🔗 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02979)

[AI Companionship]{.keyword} · [Embodied Intelligence]{.keyword} · [Technical Taxonomy]{.keyword}

::: {.pub-tldr-neurips}
**TL;DR:** Systematizes the fragmented landscape of AI persona design by introducing a novel four-quadrant technical taxonomy that maps companion applications from virtual agents to embodied systems, providing actionable design guidelines for researchers and practitioners.

::: {.pub-keypoints}
**Key Points:**

- **Four-Quadrant Taxonomy:** Proposed a systematic framework categorizing AI companions along two orthogonal axes—embodiment level and interaction modality—to clarify design trade-offs across diverse application domains.
- **Technical Design Patterns:** Identified and documented recurring architectural patterns for persona consistency, memory management, and emotional coherence across 50+ commercial and research systems.
- **Embodiment Spectrum Analysis:** Analyzed the progression from text-only virtual companions to fully embodied robotic agents, mapping key technical challenges at each stage of the embodiment continuum.
- **Actionable Guidelines:** Synthesized practical design recommendations for balancing persona authenticity, user safety, and system scalability in real-world AI companion deployments.
