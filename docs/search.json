    "text": "About Me\n\nI am a Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2026), where I focus on Multimodal Machine Learning. I am privileged to be supervised by Prof. Carlos Busso. My academic journey began at the University of Toronto, where I earned an Honors Bachelor of Science with a double major in Computer Science and Statistical Science. During my undergraduate years, I also spent time as an exchange student at Tsinghua University’s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS/Yao Class).\nMy research trajectory has evolved from early work in multimodal CV–NLP systems — particularly explainable image forgery detection and multimodal fact verification — toward a current specialization in Affective Computing and Emotion Intelligence, focusing on multimodal emotion recognition and AI persona. My recent work centers on understanding emotional ambiguity in real-world human communication, such as ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Probing Tools), which combines multimodal large language models with reinforcement learning (GRPO) to generate evidence-grounded rationales for ambiguous emotional states. I believe the future of AI lies not just in providing the “right” answer, but in communicating with emotional intelligence and context-aware empathy—ensuring that agents respond in the most appropriate and human-centric manner."

The framework redefines emotion inference as an iterative inquiry process, where the agent programmatically orchestrates a specialized toolkit of semantic and acoustic probes to decode complex paralinguistic cues.\nEvidence-Grounded Rationalization: Developed a retrieval-augmented rationalization mechanism that anchors model predictions in verifiable physical evidence. By extracting and analyzing pitch trajectories, energy profiles, and spectral centroids, the system effectively mitigates text-biased hallucinations and provides high-fidelity, auditable reasoning traces.\nReinforcement Learning Alignment (GRPO): Implemented Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the agent’s multi-step decision-making trajectories. This alignment strategy optimizes the policy-driven evidence acquisition process, rewarding logical rigor and penalizing non-informative tool invocations to ensure the reasoning path aligns with human-expert diagnostic standards.\nAmbiguity-Driven Reasoning: Formulated a novel approach to address the “Consensus Paradox” by treating annotator disagreement as a valuable supervision signal rather than noise. By modeling emotional ambiguity through a consensus-driven inquiry process, the framework significantly improves robustness and recovery of co-occurring minor emotions on benchmark datasets including MSP-Podcast and IEMOCAP.\n\nThis work explores how agentic multimodal models can move beyond pattern recognition toward verifiable, evidence-grounded reasoning under perceptual ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICASSP 2026 Accepted\n\nRecovering Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition from Discrete Tokens via Multi-Layer Fusion and Paralinguistic Feature Integration\nFirst Author | 🔗 Paper\nDiscrete Audio Tokenization · Multi-layer Attention Fusion · SSL · Neural Codecs\n\nTL;DR: Introduces a multi-layer fusion framework to recover the significant performance loss in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) caused by audio discretization, enabling semantic-rich discrete tokens to rival high-fidelity continuous features.\n\nKey Points:\n\nPerformance Recovery: Developed a novel framework that recovers 75% of the performance drop induced by discretization by integrating multi-layer WavLM tokens with 74-dimensional openSMILE paralinguistic features.\nArchitecture Innovation: Designed and benchmarked dual fusion strategies—Layer-First and Modality-First—achieving an 8% gain with the Layer-First approach by prioritizing hierarchical feature extraction.\nAblation & Trade-offs: Conducted systematic studies across 24 WavLM layers and 5 codebook sizes (K=256 to 4000) to identify optimal compression-accuracy trade-offs for emotion preservation.\nNeural Codec Benchmarking: Evaluated against three major neural codecs (SpeechTokenizer, DAC, and EnCodec), demonstrating that semantic-rich SSL tokens provide a 50%+ performance advantage over reconstruction-focused models for downstream SER tasks.\n\nThis work establishes semantic-rich discrete speech tokens as a viable alternative to continuous acoustic features for affective computing, bridging representation learning and downstream emotion reasoning under aggressive compression constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeurIPS 2025 Workshop Accepted\n\nSystematizing LLM Persona Design: A Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI Companion Applications\nFirst Author | 🔗 Paper\nAI Companionship · Embodied Intelligence · Technical Taxonomy\n\nTL;DR: Systematizes the fragmented landscape of AI persona design by introducing a novel four-quadrant technical taxonomy that maps companion applications from virtual agents to embodied systems, providing actionable design guidelines for researchers and practitioners.\n\nKey Points:\n\nFour-Quadrant Taxonomy: Proposed a systematic framework categorizing AI companions along two orthogonal axes—embodiment level and interaction modality—to clarify design trade-offs across diverse application domains.\nTechnical Design Patterns: Identified and documented recurring architectural patterns for persona consistency, memory management, and emotional coherence across 50+ commercial and research systems.\nEmbodiment Spectrum Analysis: Analyzed the progression from text-only virtual companions to fully embodied robotic agents, mapping key technical challenges at each stage of the embodiment continuum.\nActionable Guidelines: Synthesized practical design recommendations for balancing persona authenticity, user safety, and system scalability in real-world AI companion deployments.\n\nThis work provides a unifying systems-level lens for LLM persona agents, enabling principled design and evaluation of AI companions across virtual, multimodal, and embodied interaction settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIEEE TPAMI 2024 Under Review\n\nForgeryGPT: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Image Forgery Detection and Localization\nCo-author | 🔗 Paper\nFine-grained forgery localization · Vision–language reasoning · Multimodal LLM grounding\n\nTL;DR: Leverages Multimodal LLMs to pioneer an explainable image forgery detection and localization system that generates natural language rationales for identified visual manipulations.\n\nKey Points:\n\nHybrid Vision Architecture: Developed a “Vocabulary-enhanced Vision Encoder” integrating a trainable ViT with a frozen CLIP encoder to capture fine-grained, domain-specific forgery artifacts.\nAdaptive Forgery Prompting: Proposed an “Object-agnostic Forgery Prompt” mechanism using 12-dimensional learnable embeddings to enable dynamic adaptation across diverse forgery scenarios, achieving a 15% improvement over baselines.\nLarge-Scale Synthesis Pipeline: Constructed a comprehensive 768K+ multimodal dataset using a multi-granularity mask generation pipeline that combines random segmentation with Segment Anything Model (SAM) techniques.\nExplainable Localization: Contributed the FL-Expert module to provide precise spatial localization coupled with linguistic explanations of splicing, copy-move, and removal manipulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACM MM 2023 Accepted\n\nECENet: Explainable and Context-Enhanced Network for Multimodal Fact Verification\nCo-author | 🔗 Paper\nDual-granularity Attention · Cross-modal Alignment · Hierarchical Reasoning\n\nTL;DR: Introduces a state-of-the-art multimodal fact verification framework that utilizes dual-granularity attention and hierarchical reasoning to generate evidence-based justifications for news veracity.\n\nKey Points:\n\nDual-Granularity Attention: Engineered an Improved Coarse- and Fine-grained Attention Network (CFgAN) that enhanced contextual comprehension of image-text correlations by 12.1%.\nHierarchical Reasoning Framework: Developed a unified architecture for feature extraction and cross-modal fusion, enabling the system to perform complex evidence-based inference.\nBenchmark Leadership: Achieved SOTA performance on major benchmarks, including 87.7% accuracy on NewsCLIPpings and an 81.5 F1-score on FACTIFY.\nJustification Generation: Focused on “explainability” by ensuring the network provides logical justifications alongside its verification results, as showcased in oral and poster presentations at ACM MM 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAAAI 2023 Accepted\n\nUnimodal Feature-Enhanced and Cross-Modal Correlation Learning for Multimodal Fact Verification\nCo-author | 🔗 Paper\nMultimodal
